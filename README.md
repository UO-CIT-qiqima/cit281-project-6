Project 6 Overview:
I am creating three classes.
The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. 
The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class.
The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.

The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value.
