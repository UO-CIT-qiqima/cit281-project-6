Project 6 Overview:
I am creating three classes.
The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes and I use arrow function to calculate the perimeter of the specific shape. 
The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class and I use arrow function to calculate the rectangle area.
The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class and I use the arrow to calculate the triangle area.
